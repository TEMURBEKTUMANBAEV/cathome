                  Good evening, everyone. My name is Temirbek. I'm 18 years old.
                  Now I live in the city of Karakol and study at the DevX IT
                  school. At the lesson on Soft-skills, I did not understand the
                  topic about Blockchain. And when I got home, I started looking
                  for all possible topics about blockchain. And after reading
                  all the sites about blockchain. I concluded that the
                  blockchain is a database with transactions consisting of a
                  sequentially built chain of digital blocks, each of which
                  stores information about the previous and next blocks.
                  Blockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that
                  allows you to organize an open exchange of information within
                  a business network. The blockchain database stores data in
                  blocks linked together in a chain. Currently, blockchain
                  technologies are used in areas such as financial transactions,
                  user identification or the creation of cybersecurity
                  technologies, and are also relevant for banking institutions
                  and government organizations. According to this criterion ,
                  blockchains can be divided into four groups: 1)Public
                  decentralized blockchains. 2)Public blockchains with delegated
                  management. 3)Private controlled blockchains. 4) State
                  blockchains. Basically, government agencies and banks use
                  blockchains. Rarely used for cybersecurity. So let's get to
                  the point about blockchain — it is a developing innovative
                  technology that is being implemented in various industries.
                  Well, this is my little presentation about the blockchain has
                  come to an end thank you for your attention and bye to
                  everyone!
